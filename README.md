## Model Based Testing Corse - Basic Examples of Automata Learning

## About AALpy and Active Automata Learning
We use [AALpy](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy), automata learning library written in python.
If you are interested in AALpy itself, take a look at [its paper](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-88885-5_5).

For a practical guide to active automata learning with AALpy, check out its [Wiki](https://github.com/DES-Lab/AALpy/wiki).

### Install and Run
Install `aalpy` with pip. Install and add graphviz to your path for model visualization.
To run each example, simply run its script.

### Examples
- Regex Example - given a regular expression learn a DFA that conforms to it
- Counter Example - learn a model of a simple counter that counts up to some upper bound
- Gearbox Example - car gearbox that can break
- Vending Machine - a vending machine and few of its mutants
- Coffee Machine - faulty coffee machine. Includes an example with a stochastic fault.
